/*  0940 - Simple continuous rotation servo motor demo
 * 
 * This sketch shows you how to control a continuous rotation 5V servo motor 
 * connected directly to the Arduino.
 * 
 * The sketch makes the servo's arm move continuisly in different speeds.
 * 
 * 
 * Components
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - One continuous rotation servo motor
 *  - A small electrolitic capacitor
 *  
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------
 *  - Servo (comes with the Arduino IDE)
 *
 * Connections
 * -----------
 *  
 * For the motors:
 * Brown wire: Breadboard's "-" power rail.
 * Red wire: Breadboard's "+" power rail.
 * Yellow wire: Arduino pin 9
 * 
 * For the breadboard:
 * Connect the external power supply. The GND wire goes to the breadboard's "-" power rail. The 5V 
 * wire goes to breadboard's "+" power rail.
 * Connect a small electrolitic capacitor directly onto the power rail if you notice your servo
 * not working properly. Observe the polarity of the capacitor!
 * 
 *
