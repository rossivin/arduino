/*  0810 - 12V LED strip with TIP122 blinking
 * 
 * This sketch shows you how to drive a 12V LED strip using a TIP122 Darlington transistor.
 * 
 * The sketch makes the strip LEDs to blink on and off using an Arduino Uno digital pin.
 * 
 * This sketch was written by Peter Dalmaris for Arduino Step by Step.
 * 
 * Components
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - 1 x TIP122 transistor
 *  - 1 x 1KOhm current limiting resistor for the transistor
 *  - 1 x white LED strip (various lengths are ok)
 *  - A breadboard
 *  - Jumper wires
 *  - A wall socket 12V power supply, 12V battery, or bench power supply for powering the LED strip
 *  
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------
 *  - None
 *
 * Connections
 * -----------
 *  
 *  See the schematic that is provided with this lecture.
 *        
 *  Other information
